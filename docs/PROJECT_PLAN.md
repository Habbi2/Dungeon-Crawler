# Dungeon Crawler Game Project Plan

## Project Overview
We're creating a 2D multiplayer dungeon crawler game using Phaser.js that will be deployed on itch.io. The game will feature pixel art graphics, procedurally generated dungeons, combat mechanics, and real-time multiplayer functionality.

## Development Phases

### Phase 1: Project Setup & Basic Structure
- Set up Phaser.js project structure
- Install necessary dependencies (Phaser, Socket.io for multiplayer)
- Create development environment with hot-reloading
- Set up basic HTML5 canvas and game configuration

### Phase 2: Asset Integration & Scene Setup
- Organize and integrate existing sprite assets
- Create sprite atlas configurations
- Set up animation manager for character and monster animations
- Implement basic UI elements using existing interface assets

### Phase 3: Core Game Mechanics
- Player movement and controls (keyboard + mobile touch)
- Character animation states (idle, walking, attack)
- Camera following player
- Basic collision detection
- Implement dungeon tilemap rendering

### Phase 4: Procedural Dungeon Generation
- Create algorithm for randomized dungeon layouts
- Implement room and corridor generation
- Add traps, chests, and interactive objects
- Create enemy spawn points

### Phase 5: Combat System
- Implement player attack mechanics
- Enemy AI and pathfinding
- Health/damage system
- Death animations and respawn mechanics
- Collectible items and powerups

### Phase 6: Multiplayer Implementation
- Set up Socket.io server
- Player synchronization across clients
- Real-time position and state updates
- Handling player joining/disconnecting
- Shared world state management

### Phase 7: Game UI and HUD
- Health bars
- Inventory system
- Minimap implementation
- Mobile-friendly controls
- Settings menu

### Phase 8: Polish and Optimization
- Performance optimization for mobile
- Sound effects and background music
- Screen transitions and effects
- Touch control improvements
- Browser compatibility testing

### Phase 9: Deployment
- Build process setup
- itch.io page creation
- Game embedding and configuration
- Publishing and distribution

## Technology Stack
- Phaser 3 - Game framework
- JavaScript/ES6 - Programming language
- Socket.io - Real-time communication for multiplayer
- Webpack - Bundling and development server
- HTML5/CSS3 - Basic structure and styling
- Node.js - Server for multiplayer functionality

## Asset Organization
- Characters: Player sprites and animations
- Monsters: Enemy sprites and animations
- Environment: Dungeon tiles and decorations
- UI: Interface elements and HUD components
- Items: Collectibles, weapons, and power-ups

## Responsive Design Goals
- Adapt to different screen sizes
- Touch controls for mobile devices
- Keyboard/mouse controls for desktop
- Optimize performance for lower-end devices
