## Asset Management
- Sprites will be organized into spritesheets/texture atlases
- Animation frames will be defined in JSON configuration
- Audio will be compressed for web delivery
- Assets will be preloaded in BootScene

## Game Mechanics Specifications

### Player
- Movement: 4-directional with animations
- Actions: Attack, Interact, Use Item
- Stats: Health, Attack Power, Defense, Speed
- Inventory: Limited slots for items

### Dungeon Generation
- Random room placement with connecting corridors
- Varied room types (treasure, combat, boss, etc.)
- Progressive difficulty deeper into dungeon
- Procedural generation parameters configurable

### Enemy AI
- Pathfinding to player when in detection range
- Different behaviors per enemy type
- Attack patterns and cooldowns
- Difficulty scaling

### Combat System
- Hitbox-based collision detection
- Attack animations with active frames
- Damage calculation based on stats
- Visual feedback for hits and damage

### Multiplayer Implementation
- Room-based gameplay (4 players maximum)
- State synchronization using Socket.io
- Authority split between client/server
- Latency compensation techniques

### Mobile Optimization
- Virtual joystick for movement
- Touch buttons for actions
- Responsive UI that scales to screen size
- Performance optimizations for mobile devices

## Browser Compatibility
- Target browsers: Chrome, Firefox, Safari, Edge (latest 2 versions)
- Mobile browsers: Chrome for Android, Safari iOS
- PWA capabilities for improved mobile experience

## Deployment
- Host multiplayer server on affordable platform (Heroku, Glitch, etc.)
- Package game client for itch.io deployment
- Implement analytics to track player engagement

This document will evolve as development progresses with more detailed specifications.
